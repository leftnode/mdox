## About
`mdox` is a small program for generating documentation from Markdown. It comes with a nice template by default that you can easily update. I wrote this because I was disatisfied with the rest of the automated documentation generators out there.

## Copyright
This software is PHP and uses the PHP Markdown library. All other code is &copy; Vic Cherubini. If you find this software useful, please let me know. I get a big thrill when I learn that.
